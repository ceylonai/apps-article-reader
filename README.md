# Content Extractor

A powerful desktop application for extracting and analyzing content from web URLs. Built with Python and Tkinter, this tool provides a user-friendly interface for processing multiple URLs simultaneously, extracting key information, and saving results locally.

## Features

- **URL Processing**: Process multiple URLs simultaneously with a queue-based system
- **Content Analysis**: Extract titles, keywords, summaries, and generate relevant hashtags
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates and progress monitoring for each task
- **Auto-save**: Automatically save processed content to local files
- **Task Management**: Pause, restart, or review completed tasks
- **Configurable Settings**: Customize save directory and auto-save preferences

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- tkinter (usually comes with Python)
- Ollama for running the LLaMA model

## Installing Ollama

1. Install Ollama based on your operating system:

### Linux
```bash
curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
```

### macOS
```bash
brew install ollama
```

### Windows
Download and run the installer from [Ollama's official website](https://ollama.ai/download)

2. Start the Ollama service:
```bash
ollama serve
```

3. Pull the LLaMA model:
```bash
ollama pull llama2
```

4. Verify the installation:
```bash
ollama list
```

You should see `llama2` in the list of available models.

5. Configure the application to use Ollama:
   - The application is pre-configured to use "llama3.2" as the model name
   - Update the model name in `ContentExtractor` initialization if using a different model version

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd content-extractor
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Ensure Ollama is running:
   - Start Ollama service if not already running
   - Verify the LLaMA model is available

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
python content_extractor_gui.py
```

2. Configure Settings:
   - Click "Browse" to set your preferred project directory
   - Toggle auto-save option as needed

3. Process URLs:
   - Enter a URL in the input field
   - Click "Add URL" to start processing
   - Monitor progress in the tasks list
   - View results by clicking on completed tasks

4. Managing Tasks:
   - Click on any task to view its details
   - Use the restart button (â†») to reprocess failed or completed tasks
   - Save results manually using the "Save Result" button if auto-save is disabled

## Task States

- **Queued**: Task is waiting to be processed
- **Processing**: Currently extracting content
- **Completed**: Successfully processed
- **Error**: Failed to process (can be restarted)

## Output Format

Results are saved as JSON files with the following structure:
```json
{
    "title": "Article Title",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", ...],
    "content_summary": "Brief summary of the content",
    "hashtags": ["#hashtag1", "#hashtag2", ...],
    "full_article": "Complete article text"
}
```

## Configuration

The application stores its configuration in `content_extractor_config.json`:
```json
{
    "project_dir": "/path/to/save/directory",
    "auto_save": true
}
```

## Technical Details

### Key Components

1. **URLTask**: Manages individual URL processing tasks
   - Tracks status, progress, and results
   - Handles timing and error states

2. **TaskPanel**: UI component for displaying task information
   - Real-time status updates
   - Progress bar
   - Duration tracking
   - Save path display

3. **ContentExtractorGUI**: Main application interface
   - Manages task queue and threading
   - Handles file I/O and configuration
   - Provides user interface controls

### Threading Model

- Uses a queue-based system for task management
- Processes multiple URLs concurrently
- Maintains UI responsiveness with proper thread management
- Limits concurrent processing to prevent resource exhaustion

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid URLs
- Network issues
- Processing failures
- File system operations
- Configuration management
